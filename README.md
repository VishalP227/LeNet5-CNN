# Convolution Neural Networks (LeNet5)

### Project Description
The main goals of this project are as listed below:
- Implement and understand CNN architecture, specifically LeNet5
- Training the convolutional nerual network on MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR 10 dataset
- Network parameters (learning rate, momentum, training batch size) tuning 
- Evaluation and Ablation study: Analyze Receiver Operating characteristic Curve (ROC) and Area under curve (AUC) metrics 
- Analyse classification performance on noisy data (by intrducing symmetric label noise)
